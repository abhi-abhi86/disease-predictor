## 🛠️ Installation

### Option 1: Run from Source (Development)
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/abhi-abhi86/Multi-Species-Disease-Detection-and-Management-System.git
cd Multi-Species-Disease-Detection-and-Management-System/DiseaseDetectionApp

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the application
python main.py
```

### Option 2: Standalone macOS Application
Download the latest release from the [Releases](https://github.com/abhi-abhi86/Multi-Species-Disease-Detection-and-Management-System/releases) page.

## 🏗️ Building Standalone Application

### For macOS
```bash
# Install py2app
pip install py2app

# Build the application
python setup.py py2app

# The app will be created in the 'dist' folder
```

### For Windows (using PyInstaller)
```bash
# Install PyInstaller
pip install pyinstaller

# Build the executable
pyinstaller --onefile --windowed main.py

# The executable will be in the 'dist' folder
```

## 🎯 Usage

1. **Launch the Application**: Run `main.py` or the standalone app
2. **Select Species Tab**: Choose between Plants, Humans, or Animals
3. **Upload Image**: Click "Browse Image" to select a disease image
4. **Get Diagnosis**: Click "Diagnose" for AI-powered analysis
5. **View Results**: See diagnosis, confidence score, and treatment recommendations
6. **Research More**: Access PubMed articles and Wikipedia information

### Adding New Diseases
1. Go to **File → Add New Disease** (Ctrl+N)
2. Fill in disease details (name, description, symptoms, treatment)
3. Optionally retrain the model immediately or later
4. Use **Tools → Retrain Model** (Ctrl+R) to include new diseases

## 🔧 System Requirements

- **OS**: macOS 10.14+, Windows 10+, Linux
- **Python**: 3.8 or higher
- **RAM**: 4GB minimum, 8GB recommended
- **Storage**: 500MB for application + models
- **Dependencies**: PyQt5, PyTorch, OpenCV

## 🧪 Testing
